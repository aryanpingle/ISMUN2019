							</header>
							<p>
								The General Assembly is made up of six different committees, the first of which is DISEC. The committee's sole purpose is to facilitate the exchange of ideas about disarmament and to maintain the global solidity, so as to avoid escalation of tension and preserve global harmony. DISEC promotes cooperative arrangements and measures aimed at strengthening ties between nations so as to reduce the levels of armaments held by each nation.

								Comprehensive analysis of the problem of the extremists' weaponry usage and supply in the light of the fourth and fifth generation warfare.
							</p>
							<header>
								<h2 id="big-strong">Summary</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								Right now extremists groups are wrecking havoc faster than ever before. But have you thought why? Due to the emergence of new kinds of warfare, namely the fourth and fifth generation warfare. So what is this fourth generation warfare? Military thinkers describe it as a decentralized form of conflict or war, characterized by a surge of violence initiated by a non-state actor against the state. The reason it has been give this name - today almost every attempt to sabotage national and international security takes this form.
							</p>
							<p>
								For instance, the very well known cases of taliban insurgency in Afghanistan or the notorious  Iraqi insurgency which paved the way for the  Iraqi war (2003-11), both of which show the large-scale impact these conflicts can have not just on the national harmony but also international stability. Over the years, this concept of the fourth generation warfare developed to become what we currently call the fifth generation warfare, which basically relates itself to attacks by loosely organized networks who attack nations in the name of some unified cause  which may not necessarily be political in nature. A very good example for this would be the very recent New Zealand shootings which was allegedly an attack largely communal in nature.
							</p>
							<p>
								So what exactly is the problem here? Is it the fact that despite numerous measures taken in the direction of curbing illicit trade of weapons, these non-state actors still manage to get hold of professional weaponry and raw materials for its creation? Or is it the fact that even though so much of the global expenditure is spent on technology and defence to ensure security and world peace through and through, these organizations still somehow manage to create havoc right under our noses? More importantly, what are the solutions to such violence, which is one of the most pressing problems of our century and how can the nations deal with it? This is what our aim shall, be here at DISEC. Every delegate shall have equal importance in  the committee. Every speech is capable of making a difference to the committee proceedings.There are only a few committees as dynamic as the DISEC. Do you think you have what it takes to resolve global issues and handle the global tension? If yes, then welcome to DISEC.

										<h5>Janavi Nainani</h5>
										<h6><accent3>Director</accent3></h6>
										<p>
											Janavi is the perfect living representation of "quiet with the loudest mind". One thing that stands out about her is that you could be the most random stranger to her and she would still manage to use her words to make you feel better. A massive believer in being empathetic and indiscriminate whatsoever, she is always in search for conversations that would lead her to look at the same ideas from an entirely new dimension. Apart from being a hard core grammar nazi, she likes spending her days listening to music, reading books and being a psychology geek.

										<p>
											Arsh Merchant is a person who has a genial attitude. When it comes to speeches you would need your earplugs for all his speeches are loud and blazing. He never stops until he proves his point, and his soft heart makes him approachable. His experience and tenaciousness prove without a shadow of doubt that he is not a guy to be messed with.

										<h6><accent3>Moderator</accent3></h6>
										<p>
											Shreyas Pakhare is a person who quickly adapts to the situation. Do not commit the mistake of misinterpreting his calm nature, for he is capable of making speeches which ensure that his point is made in the discussion.
											<br>A science student, he loves to play as well as follow football and appreciates subtle sarcasm in the committee. More than excited to chair DISEC, his amicable nature make him the go-to person for delegates.
